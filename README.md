# calculator
A calculator is a device that performs arithmetic operations on
numbers. Basic calculators can do only addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division mathematical calculations.


However, more sophisticated calculators can handle exponential
operations, square roots, logarithms, trigonometric functions and
hyperbolic functions. Internally, some calculators perform all these

This project is all about basic calculator .It also called as four -
function calculator .It perform only four operation like addition ,
subtraction , multiplication and multiplication on single digit
numbers

MODULES USED IN THIS PROJECT
===============================
*A set of functionalities written in a source file is called a module.

*This is a single module project used only standard c library function.


ADVANTAGES
=========

This is simple calculator only operate with single digit .
so there is a advantages which help me so much know about what a project
exactly and how to create a project


TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED
=================================

The basic calculator is written in standard C language .The interface of
calculator was developed with the help of GTK Glade interface .The
backend programming are written in Data structure using C and mainly
used stack Data structure with infix to prefix and prefix evaluation.
